This is a exploration to the methodology and algorithms employed in the Kaggle competition 'AMEX default prediction'. Due to the physical limit of ardware, there is no way to contain a 50GB datasets in my computer, so I continue to use the raw lending club datasets(2007-2018) also from Kaggle, which has a pleasant size of 1.6GB.
